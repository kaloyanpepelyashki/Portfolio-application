          specialize in in JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET (C#), React, and SQL.
          I’m all about problem-solving, optimization, and crafting scalable
          software solutions that make an impact. Most recently, I’ve been
          assisting the team at Kazboo, leading the migration and optimization
          of an existing solution, I thrive in roles that challenge me, I enjoy
          dissecting complex architectures, improving performance, and crafting
          solutions that stand the test of time. Beyond development, I enjoy
          mentoring aspiring developers at HackYourFuture. In my free time,
          you’ll find me working on side projects, exploring photography, or in
          the gym. Always ready to learn and collaborate, I’m excited to tackle
          new challenges—let’s connect
